This suggests that the patient needs regular check-ups to monitor the condition and make any necessary adjustments to his care plan.\n\n2. **Avoidance of Cardiac Catheterization:** At this time, a cardiac catheterization procedure is not recommended due to the patient's current physical condition. This indicates that the risks of the procedure currently outweigh the potential benefits, likely due to his severe pulmonary stenosis and high pulmonary artery systolic pressure.\n\nIt's important to note that the treatment approach may evolve based on the patient's condition and response to ongoing management. Regular consultations with the cardiologist will help determine any future interventions or changes in the treatment plan."}]
